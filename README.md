# ML-Model-Insurance-company

This is my first ML project. 
This aims to predict the approximate annual amount that a person has to pay for his insurance on the basis of his/her age , sex , number of children , region of living and whether they are smoke or not.

The dataset used is : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JovianML/opendatasets/master/data/medical-charges.csv"
